# Python

> [!NOTE]
> This is a python dōjō
>
> This is to showcase some level of proficiency with Python.</br>
> In the past I used Python in different occasions, from basic scripting exercises to custom production-grade ETL solutions integrating different AWS solutions: S3, SQS, StepFunction and Lambda's written in NodeJs and Python manipulating CV and EXCEL Dataframes with Pandas</br>
> In this repo I will hopefully keep adding basic exercises using Python for basic scripting, graphic tools, webpages, REST API's, data analysis and LLM's
