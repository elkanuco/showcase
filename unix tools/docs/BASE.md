## base distributions

| Distribution | Overview                                                                                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Debian       | One of the oldest and most stable Linux distributions, Debian is community-driven, focuses on free software, and uses the APT package management system. It serves as a base for many other distributions, including Ubuntu. Known for stability and large software repositories. |
| Ubuntu       | A popular Debian-based distribution designed for ease of use on desktops and servers. Ubuntu focuses on user-friendliness, regular releases, and extensive community support. It supports a wide range of hardware and offers commercial backing from Canonical.              |
| Red Hat      | A commercial Linux distribution aimed at enterprises, famous for stability, security, and long-term support. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is widely used in corporate environments. It uses RPM packages and provides professional support and certifications.       |
| CentOS       | Originally a free rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux source code, CentOS offers a free, stable enterprise-grade OS compatible with RHEL. Itâ€™s popular for servers, with long-term support. It is now transitioning to CentOS Stream, a continuously delivered distro upstream of RHEL. |
| Fedora       | A cutting-edge community-driven distribution sponsored by Red Hat. Fedora includes the latest features, technologies, and software versions. It serves as a testing ground for innovations before they are incorporated into RHEL. Focused on rapid release cycles and innovation. |

> **Note:**
> Debian / Ubuntu Family uses APT with .deb packages
> Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora Family uses DNF/YUM with .rpm packages

> **Note:**
> Pseudo-filesystems such as /proc, /sys, and /dev exist entirely in memory and provide dynamic interfaces to the kernel and hardware. They do not correspond to real files stored on disk.
> Other special directories like /bin, /etc, /home, /usr, /var, /opt, /tmp, /root, etc., are real directories on disk containing actual files and data.
> Some directories like /tmp and /run may use tmpfs, a temporary in-memory filesystem, depending on system configuration, so they may reside in memory but can also be backed by disk in some cases.
> The /proc filesystem is an interface to the kernel data structures. /proc contains a subdirectory for each active process, named by the process id (PID). /proc/self is the currently executing process. Some tunable parameters are in the /proc directories.
